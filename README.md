# Express Course

## Step 1 (Setting Up Server)

###  Installation:
    -   git init
    -   npm init -y
    -   npm i express --save-dev

###  Create .gitignore
    -   node_modules
    -   .env

###  Create server.js
    -   Import the Express library, which is a lightweight framework for building web servers in Node.js

    -   Create an instance of the Express application, which represents your web server

    -   Define the port number on which the server will listen for incoming requests

    -   Start the server and make it listen on the specified port.
    -   Once the server starts, log a message indicating it is running and on which port.

###  Run the app
    -   node server.js OR node server OR npm start

###  git push
    - GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pbczmm" git push origin main

#### Note:
